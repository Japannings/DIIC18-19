 * Short Description: 
   This project, made for Arduino, controls
   a few sensors on a plant watering device.
   The values from the sensores are converted
   in a human understanble values and then they 
   are sent to a Wi-Fi module.
   
   The architecture chosen for this device is
   a simple Round-Robin, measuring each sensor
   on every cycle.
